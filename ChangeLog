2004-03-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libgda/src/serverprovider.hg, datamodel.hg: Wrapped new methods.

2004-03-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* tools/extra_defs_gen/generate_defs.gda.cc: Include glibmm_extra_defs
	rather than the old gtkmm one, to really fix the build.

2004-03-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* examples/simple now also builds and works, though it is not yet 
	a real example.

2004-03-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libgda/libgdamm/config.cc: get_gda_params(): Use OWNERSHIP_NONE so 
	that we do not delete parts of the struct field that we do not own.
	examples/list_data_sources now runs without crashing.

2004-03-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Now uses glibmm 2.4 instead of gtkmm 2.2.

2004-02-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libgda/src/datamodel.hg: Renamed the C++ methods to match the
	C function names, correcting the previous change. The API is not 
	stable so we are free to change them to match changes in libgda.

2003-12-17  Billy O'Connor <billyoc@gnuyork.org>

	* libgda/src/libgda_methods.defs:
	* libgda/src/datamodel.hg: Changes to is_editable(), is_editing(),
	begin_edit(), cancel_edit() and end_edit() wrappers to reflect 
	libgda function renames.

2003-11-05  Alexander Nedotsukov <bland@mail.ru>

	* libgda/libgda-2.0.pc.in: Fixed pkgconfig package dependency and
	library list. 

2003-10-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Added wrappers for Client, Config, DataSourceInfo, ProviderInfo,
	and used the C++ types in the rest of the API.
	* libgda/libgdamm/init.[h|cc]: Added Gnome::Gda::init() function.
	* Added examples/list_data_sources.

1.3.0:
	
2003-10-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* libgda/libgdamm/private/Makefile.am: Use _HEADERS instead of
	_DATA (I looked at gnome-vfsmm) to fix the dist. distcheck now
	works.

2002-12-10  Bradley Bell  <btb@debian.org>
	
	* scripts/Makefile.am: distribute macros.m4

2002-11-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* libgdammconfig.h and init.h: Replaced "libgnomemm" with
	"libgdamm".

2002-07-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Connection, DataModel: wrapped a few more functions.

2002-07-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* DataModel: We don't need to specify the _vfunc suffixes now -
	gtkmmproc adds them for us.

2002-07-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Added Transaction wrapper, used in Connection methods.

2002-05-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Revised build files so that they are like the other gnomemm
	projects - this means that generated source is now distributed.
	* Updated libgda_methods.defs and libgda_enums.defs for the libgda
	HEAD branch refactoring. It now builds against libgda HEAD.

2002-04-19  Muray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Removed traces of libgnomemm, from which this project was copied
	when it was first created.

2002-04-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Build: Make it depend on glibmm rather than gtkmm, although they
	are both in the same package at the moment.

2002-04-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Added basic wrappers for GdaError and GdaDataModel, and used
	those C++ types in the Gda::Connection interface, so that
	people get the general idea.
	* Added libgda_vuncs.defs (hand coded) and libgda_enums.defs
	(generated with gtkmm/tools/enums.pl)
