	* Removed traces of libgnomemm, from which this project was copied
	when it was first created.

	* Build: Make it depend on glibmm rather than gtkmm, although they
	are both in the same package at the moment.

	* Added basic wrappers for GdaError and GdaDataModel, and used
	those C++ types in the Gda::Connection interface, so that
	people get the general idea.
	* Added libgda_vuncs.defs (hand coded) and libgda_enums.defs
	(generated with gtkmm/tools/enums.pl)
