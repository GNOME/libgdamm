1.3.0:

This is an initial tarball version, to try to get some attention. A fairly random part of the libgda API has been wrapped, and there are no examples yet (I have some problems with my local mysql installation.). So the chances of anything working are small. If you'd like this stuff to work, you should try to create an example and submit patches.
